# 0x04. Python - Exceptions
A project that was targeted at helping me gain the practical knowledge of
the use of exception handlings in python programming, and solving problems
with it, with an excellent understanding of the difference between Errors
and Exceptions. It had seven mandatory tasks as follows:
### 0. Safe list printing
A function tha prints x elements of a list
### 1. Safe printing of an integers list
A function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format()
### 2. Print and count integers
A function that prints the first x elements of a list and only integers
### 3. Integers division with debug
A function that divides 2 integers and prints the result
### 4. Divide a list
A function that divides element 2 lists
### 5. Raise exception
A function that raises a type exception
### 6. Raise a message
A function that raises a name exception with a message
## Advanced tasks
7. Write a function that prints an integer
8. Write a function that executes a function safely
9. Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode
10 Create three C functions that print some basic info about Python lists, Python bytes an Python float objects
