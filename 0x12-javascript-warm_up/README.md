# JavaScript - Warm up
A project that had to do with the fundamentals of **JavaScript**

While doing this project, I learned:
- How to run a **JavaScript** script
- How to create variables and constants
- The differences between `var`, `const` and `let`
- The data types avaible in **JavaScript**
- How to use `if`, `if...else` statements
- How to use comments
- How to affect values to variables
- How to use `while` and `for` loops
- How to use `break` and `continue` statements
- Functions in **JavaScript**
- Scope of variables
- Arithmetic operators and how to use them
- How to manipulate dictionary
- How to import a file

I did this project with the text editor `emacs` as none other (except `vi` and `vim`) were allowed. It was done in **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `node` (version 14.21.1) and all the code were made `semistandard` compliant (version 16.0.1)
